# Filter Projects

## Value Proposition

**As a user**

**I want to** filter projects based on their complexity,

**so that** I can quickly find projects that match my skill level and preferences.

## Description

- Users can filter projects by complexity.
- Only one complexity filter can be selected at a time.
- Selecting a new complexity filter automatically deselects the previously selected complexity filter.
- The applied filter is clearly displayed on the projects list, allowing users to see which filter is currently active.
- Users can clear all filters with a single click, returning the list to its unfiltered state.
- The projects list updates in real-time as filters are applied or removed.
