# 🛠️ Hammerhart - Your DIY Hub!
Hammerhart is a web app that my colleagues and I developed during our intensive coding bootcamp at "neue fische." <br>
The app is designed for all DIY enthusiasts and hobbyists who want to discover new projects and manage their own ideas. <br>
The main idea behind Hammerhart was to create a platform that allows users to manage their DIY projects easily and clearly. <br>
The app offers an intuitive user interface and enables seamless management for all your projects — from creating and editing to deleting projects.

## Key Features
**➕ Create own projects:** Users can create their own DIY projects by adding titles, descriptions, materials, step-by-step instructions, and more. This allows for complete documentation and presentation of their creative work.
<br>

**♥️ Favorite projects:** The favorites feature allows users to mark their favorite projects so they can easily find and revisit them. This way, they can always keep track of the most inspiring ideas.
<br>

**🕒 Track progess:** Users can track the progress of their projects step by step by marking materials and tasks with a simple checkbox. This feature supports a structured and efficient workflow.
<br>

**📝 Individual notes:** Personal notes can be added to each project to capture important details, thoughts, or ideas. This feature helps document the creative process and ensures that no important information is forgotten.
